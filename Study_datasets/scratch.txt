Understanding data provided:

Time-series data over multiple different time frames is provided on 100 Suppplies/clients. (multivariate time-series)
Given the history of these supplies, whether their overrall behaviour was anomoulous, regular or fraudulous is also provided.

Variables and their time frames:

- Suppy status and available power: A fixed time frame is not present. Each supply has a few years not equally partioned, 
with available_power and supply status. Terminated status has None value for available power (makes sense) and there is missing data
(availabel power) in some active status rows.

- Consumption: A fixed time frame is present. Quarter hour measured consumption (for entire day). Number of days not clear yet.

- Works: A fixed time frame also not present. Works happen for each supply over the years, but no fixed time frame is defined

- Interruptions: Interruptions are also not logged with fixed time frame.

- Status Words: No fixed time frame


How can these different variables with different time frames can be combined to train an ML?

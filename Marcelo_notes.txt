reconstruct dataset. (idea: use each data points deviation from register mean of that Supply_ID)
For each supply compute averages of each of the 96 time frames over x days. Then with these averages compute the deviations of each data point of their corresponding supply and time frame average.

Further granulate data try 5 and 2 day periods
Make plots to vizualize anomalies: regular vs anomaly mean for each period

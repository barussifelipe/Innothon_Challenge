Model Restructure

Schema: (Supply_ID, Time_interval, Feature1, Feature2, ... ..., Label)

Idea: Determine time intervals to which, for each corresponding Supply_ID, will have its characteristic features (need to be defined)


Time interval: 
    - First idea: synchronize intervals, as in same dates (Very unlikely to be possible)
    - Second idea: Organize intervals by supply history. In more detail, each interval has the same length and is ordered according to time.
        For example: Each interval represents a week of a supply. First interval is the first week of available data of this supply. Second interval is the second week and so on.
        Each interval will not be synchronized by dates, but will be synchronized by order in which it happened to that supply

        Example dataset:

        Supply_ID, Interval, Feature1, Label

            0       0                   Fraud
            0       1                   Fraud
            0       2                   Fraud
            1       0                   Regular
            1       1                   Regular
            1       2
            2       0
            2       1   
            2       2
            3       0
            3       1   
            3       2

Implementing second idea:
    - Select time interval: Yearly (for now)
    - Select which datasets to use: Works , Consumption, Customer info and Interruptions (Add more later)
    - For each data set group information by supply per year

        Consumption:
